## Objectives

- Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

- The pandemic not only caused widespread health problems, but it also had a negative social, macroeconomic, and microeconomic impact.

- The purpose of this analysis is to assess the global and national impact of COVID-19, as well as to discover correlations between different parameters on death of patients due to COVid-19.

## Assumptions

- The dataset contains 230,867 records of COVID-19 daily report from 01/01/2020 to 12/23/2023 for 235 countries and locations around the world (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
- North Korea's data has not considered in the analysis as it has an outlier data in the dataset.
- The data for COVID-19 was based on the nations' assertions, which were sometimes inaccurate (due to political concerns or lack of recording resources). 
- Furthermore, other factors such as government policies, differing quarantine strategies, and so on influenced COVID-19 in different nations, which cannot be accounted for in the data.

### Yemen:
    - The Yemeni people have been left to fend for themselves and faced many problems such as hunger, the ongoing war, infections, diseases and lack of equipment. 
    - Only around 50% of the hospitals and healthcare facilities are in full working condition.
    - Healthcare staff and facilities lack necessary essential equipment and money.
    - Yemen is not only battling COVID-19 amid a catastrophic war, but also has to deal with other diseases such as cholera, diphtheria and measles.
