## Objectives

- Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.

- The pandemic not only caused widespread health problems, but it also had a negative social, macroeconomic, and microeconomic impact.

- The purpose of this analysis is to assess the global and national impact of COVID-19, as well as to discover correlations between different parameters on death of patients due to COVid-19.

## Assumptions

- The dataset contains 230,867 records of COVID-19 daily report from 01/01/2020 to 12/23/2023 for 235 countries and locations around the world (https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data)
- North Korea's data has not considered in the analysis as it has an outlier data in the dataset.
- The data for COVID-19 was based on the nations' assertions, which were sometimes inaccurate (due to political concerns or lack of recording resources). 
- Furthermore, other factors such as government policies, differing quarantine strategies, and so on influenced COVID-19 in different nations, which cannot be accounted for in the data.

.
### Yemen (The most affected country):
    - The Yemeni people have been left to fend for themselves and faced many problems such as hunger, the ongoing war, infections, diseases and lack of equipment. 
    - Only around 50% of the hospitals and healthcare facilities are in full working condition.
    - Healthcare staff and facilities lack necessary essential equipment and money.
    - Yemen is not only battling COVID-19 amid a catastrophic war, but also has to deal with other diseases such as cholera, diphtheria and measles.
    
## Vaccination Effect

.
### Effect of Vaccination on COVID-19:
    - Number of New Deaths Decreased as the number of Vaccine Doses Administered increased (Mainly from June 2022)
    - But there was an increase in the number of deaths in April 2022. That was due to a delay in reporting of deaths from India, and in the Africa Region.

# Key Findings

- Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) has affected almost all of the nations around the world regardless of the economic situation and the healthcare system of the countries. 

- There was no correlation in the data between social, economic and health variables such as age, life expectancy, GPD, number of hospital beds, cardiovascular disease, and diabetic disease, and the death of patients' due to COVID-19.

- The number of vaccine doses administered has a correlation with the number of patients' death due to COVID-19.

- Africa and then South America are the two continents that mostly have been affected by COVID-19 respectively.
